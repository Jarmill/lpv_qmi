#Experiments

## Two-Parameter, Two-State
`all_2_box_stab_nonsymm.m`: Main system for discrete-time.

`all_2_box_h2.m`: worst-case-H2-optimal control of the discrete-time system

`all_2_box_stab_nonsymm_cont.m`: Stabilization of the same system in continuous time, given the same data.


## Three-Parameter, Five-State
`cube_53.m`: Main system for discrete-time.
